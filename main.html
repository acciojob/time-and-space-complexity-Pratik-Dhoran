	<h1>TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity describes how an algorithm’s running time grows with input size, helping us judge how efficient it is. An algorithm with lower time complexity generally performs better as data increases.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> explains how much extra memory an algorithm needs while running. When the Space Complexity is O(n), the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
